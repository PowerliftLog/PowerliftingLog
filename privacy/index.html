Privacy Policy
Last updated: February 27, 2026

The short version: Unrack runs entirely in your browser. We don't collect, store, transmit, or sell any of your data. There is no server, no database, no analytics, and no tracking.
What Data We Access
When you import a program from Google Drive, Unrack requests read-only access to only the specific file you select through Google's file picker. We use the drive.file scope, which means we can never see or access any other files in your Drive.

The selected file is downloaded directly to your browser, parsed into a training program, and stored in your browser's local storage. The file contents never leave your device.

What We Store
All your training data — programs, workout logs, settings, and preferences — is stored in your browser's localStorage on your device. Nothing is sent to any server. There is no backend, no cloud database, and no user accounts.

What We Don't Do
We do not collect personal information. We do not use analytics or tracking scripts. We do not use cookies. We do not share, sell, or transmit any data to third parties. We do not store your Google account information. We do not retain your Google Drive access token beyond the current session.

Google OAuth
When you choose to import from Google Drive, you authenticate directly with Google. Unrack receives a temporary access token that is used solely to download your selected file. This token is not stored and expires at the end of your session.

Third-Party Services
Unrack loads fonts from Google Fonts and uses the SheetJS library for Excel file parsing. These are loaded from CDNs and do not receive any of your training data.

Data Deletion
Since all data lives in your browser, you can delete everything at any time by clearing your browser's site data for powerliftlog.github.io, or by using the Reset option in the app's Settings screen.
